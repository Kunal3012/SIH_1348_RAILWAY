**Control Flow:**

1. **User Interaction:**
   - Users access the mobile app on their Android or iOS devices.
   - They can choose to input information through text or voice.

2. **Voice Input:**
   - If users opt for voice input, the app records their spoken language.

3. **Voice Recognition:**
   - The recorded voice data is sent to Azure Speech Service for voice recognition.
   - Azure Speech Service processes the audio and converts it into text.

4. **Language Detection:**
   - A language detection component identifies the language spoken by the user from the recognized text.

5. **Translation Request:**
   - The app sends the detected text and the desired language (user's choice) to Azure Translator Service for translation.
   - Azure Translator Service translates the text into the user's preferred language.

6. **Text Input:**
   - If users choose to input text directly, they type the information in their preferred language within the app.

7. **Translation Request (Text):**
   - The app sends the entered text and the desired language to Azure Translator Service for translation.

8. **Real-time Translation:**
   - Azure Translator Service translates the text in real-time and returns the translated text to the app.

9. **Display Translations:**
   - The translated text is displayed to the user within the app in their chosen language.

10. **Station Announcements:**
    - The app receives real-time station announcements from the railway station's data feed.

11. **Language Detection for Announcements:**
    - The language of station announcements is detected using Azure Language Understanding (LUIS) to ensure accurate translation.

12. **Translation Request (Announcements):**
    - The detected station announcement text is sent to Azure Translator Service for translation.

13. **Text-to-Speech (TTS) Conversion:**
    - Azure Text-to-Speech converts translated text-based announcements into high-quality audio.

14. **Audio Playback:**
    - Translated station announcements are played back to the user in their chosen language through the app's audio interface.

15. **User Feedback:**
    - Users can provide feedback or report issues through the app, which is sent for analysis.

16. **Continuous Improvement:**
    - User feedback and usage data are collected and analyzed using Azure Application Insights and Text Analytics for improvements.
